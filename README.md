# Orchard

Growing an orchard is a matter of cycles and time. Trees need nutrients to grow fruit, fruit must ripen before it falls, and seeds must be planted in clean soil. Three players take on these roles, with the ultimate goal of growing an orchard.

I led the design and development of this game during the 2017 Mentored Undergraduate Student Experience. Our three-person research team was exploring the possibilities of lightweight networked games; I challenged myself to create a multiplayer game where each player had a distinct mini-game that both influenced and was influenced by the others.

While this iteration of the project is an incomplete prototype, I am now—seven years later!—picking up development in a dedicated repository, [orchard-2024](https://github.com/robinfriedmr/orchard-2024). This is a side-project and may see sporadic updates.
